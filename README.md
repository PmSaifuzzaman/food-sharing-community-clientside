- Food Request Management: Donors can manage food requests, update request statuses, and ensure efficient food distribution.

- JWT Authentication: The platform implements JWT-based authentication to enhance security and protect private user data. When users log in, a JWT token is generated and stored on the client-side, ensuring secure access to private routes and features. This token is sent with each API call and is verified on the server to authenticate and authorize users.

- Private Routes: Private routes are accessible only to authenticated users. These routes include features such as managing donated foods, viewing and updating food requests, and overseeing food distribution. Private routes ensure that users can only access and modify their own data, enhancing data privacy and security.
